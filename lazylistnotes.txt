Temp notes about lazy list 

Talk about lazy val first

first steps at lazy list

case class MyLazyList[A](val head: () => A, val tail: Option[MyLazyList[A]]) {
        lazy val first: A = head()
        lazy val rest = tail(first)
}

questions?

how to make an infinite repeated list like (1,1,1,1)
how to make a computed list like the fibonacci sequence

how to map flatmap and so on 

that type signature tho

final classLazyList[+A] extends AbstractSeq[A] with LinearSeq[A] with LinearSeqOps[A, LazyList, LazyList[A]] with IterableFactoryDefaults[A, LazyList] with Serializable

how to make filter
  note filter consumes to the first thing that passes, it is not fully lazy


Scala library notes

notes about how the head is not held on to when dropping and filtering
