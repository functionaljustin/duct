# Welcome to the DUCT library!

DUCT is a functional programming library for Scala. Following in the footsteps of Scalaz and Cats, DUCT brings powerful and principled abstractions from Category Theory to Scala. 

# Goals

* Simple readable code
* Watch videos of the development at [Function Justin](https://www.youtube.com/c/FunctionalJustin)
* Straightforward and readable sample code
* Scala 3 first. No backwards compatibility.
