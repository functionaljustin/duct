# Welcome to the DUCT library!
DUCT is the <b>D</b>otty[^1] <b>U</b>tilising <b>C</b>ategory <b>T</b>heory library.

Following in the footsteps of Scalaz and Cats, DUCT brings powerful and principled abstractions from Category Theory to Scala, but with some different design goals. DUCT is designed more for learning and experimentation than real world applications.

# Goals
* Simple readable code.
* Watch videos of the development at [Function Justin](https://www.youtube.com/c/FunctionalJustin)
* Straightforward and readable sample code with realistic problems and their solutions.
* Scala 3 first. No backwards compatibility.

[^1]: Before Scala 3 was known as such it was known as Dotty.
