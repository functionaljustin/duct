# Welcome to the DUCT library!

DUCT is the <b>D</b>otty <b>U</b>tilising <b>C</b>ategory <b>T</b>heory library.[^1]

Following in the footsteps of Scalaz and Cats, DUCT brings powerful and principled abstractions from Category Theory to Scala, but with some different design goals. DUCT is designed more for learning and experimentation than real world applications.

# Goals

* Implement the data types and type classes as simply as possible but no simpler.
* Documented development on YouTube: [Functional Justin](https://www.youtube.com/c/FunctionalJustin) and my [blog](http://justinhj.github.io/).
* Scala 3 first; no backwards compatibility.

# Future Features

* A simple IO type is likely along with the ability to compose parallel operations.

# Documentation

Scala doc is gradually being added.

# Packaging

The project can be accessed from GitHub packages as well as compiled and run from source directly.

TODO add instructions to configure GitHub packages in a project including the authorization.
