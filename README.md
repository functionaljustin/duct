# Welcome to the DUCT library!

DUCT is a functional programming library for Scala. Following in the footsteps of Scalaz and Cats, DUCT brings powerful and principled abstractions from Category Theory to Scala. 

It has the following goals.

- **Scala 3 first** Using the latest version of Scala without worrying about backwards compatiblity we can take full advantage of the great features introduced in Scala 3 that improve the ergonomics, simplicity and power of the language.
- **Live coding** Everything of note in DUCT will be developed either live or in prerecorded tutorial videos. Want to know about Monoids? The source code will link to a video talking about the basic ideas as well as implementing the type class from scratch!
- **Simplicity over production readiness** Did you ever try to read the Scalaz or Cats source code and hit a wall? The truth is those libraries are the result of years of iteration by dozens of contributors. The source code is not written to be read, at least by the beginner. With DUCT our goal is pedagogy over production readiness, meaning the code can be kept as simple as possible.
- **Opt-in Experimental modules** As we're not aiming to be a production ready we can in fact be more experimental, not less. The core of DUCT is a simple zero-dependency library you can use to learn about functional programming and category theory, but other optional modules will explore new features of Scala 3 whilst others will explore upcoming features of Java and the JVM platform.

Currently just getting started setting up the project and test framework. This is meant for experimentation and learning so don't use this for anything.
