# Welcome to the DUCT library!

DUCT is the <b>D</b>otty <b>U</b>tilising <b>C</b>ategory <b>T</b>heory library.[^1]

Following in the footsteps of Scalaz and Cats, DUCT brings powerful and principled abstractions from Category Theory to Scala, but with some different design goals. DUCT is designed more for learning and experimentation than real world applications.

# Goals

* Simple readable code.
* Watch videos of the development at [Functional Justin](https://www.youtube.com/c/FunctionalJustin)
* Straightforward and readable sample code with realistic problems and their solutions.
* Scala 3 first. No backwards compatibility.
* Compromise performance and applicability over simplicity.

# What you don't get in the tin

* No IO type (yet)
* Stack safety

# Documentation

There is none yet apart from the related blogs and videos linked throughout the code.

[^1]: Before Scala 3 was known as such it was known as [Dotty](https://dotty.epfl.ch/).
